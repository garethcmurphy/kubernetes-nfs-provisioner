# Kubernetes NGS Provisioner 🚀☁️  

This repository provides Kubernetes YAML deployment charts for provisioning **NGS** (Next Generation Service) with essential components such as **Service Accounts**, **Roles**, **DaemonSets**, **StatefulSets**, and more.

---

## Features ✨  

- **Complete Kubernetes Deployment**: Includes YAML configurations for all required components.  
- **Service Account and RBAC**: Pre-configured for secure access and permissions.  
- **DaemonSet and StatefulSet Support**: Manage long-running and stateful workloads efficiently.  
- **Scalable**: Ready for production-grade deployments.  

---

## Prerequisites 🛠️  

- A running **Kubernetes cluster**.  
- `kubectl` CLI installed and configured.  
- Proper permissions to deploy resources on the cluster.  

---

## Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kubernetes-ngs-provisioner.git  
cd kubernetes-ngs-provisioner  

2. Apply the YAML files:  
kubectl apply -f deployment/  

3. Verify the deployment:  
kubectl get all -n <namespace>  

---

## File Structure 📂  

- `deployment/`: Contains YAML files for all Kubernetes resources.  
  - `ngs-serviceaccount.yaml`: Service account configuration.  
  - `ngs-role.yaml`: Role and RoleBinding for access control.  
  - `ngs-daemonset.yaml`: DaemonSet definition for background services.  
  - `ngs-statefulset.yaml`: StatefulSet definition for stateful applications.  
  - `ngs-service.yaml`: Service configuration for exposing NGS.  
- `README.md`: Documentation for the repository.

## Usage 🔧  

1. **Service Account**:  
   Modify `ngs-serviceaccount.yaml` to match your requirements and namespace.  

2. **Role and RoleBinding**:  
   Update `ngs-role.yaml` with appropriate permissions for your workloads.  

3. **StatefulSet**:  
   Customize `ngs-statefulset.yaml` for persistent workloads with required storage configurations.  

4. **Deploy All Resources**:  
   kubectl apply -f deployment/
